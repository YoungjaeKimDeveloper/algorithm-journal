# 10-04-2025 Hash Map

- Hash Map Reflection (10-04-2025)
Example: {nails: 1000}
→ nails is the key, 1000 is the value

- Core Idea
A key is used to directly access the value in memory

Acts like an address to find data fast

Only the key is searchable — not the value

- Key Features
One-way (key → value only)

Deterministic (same key → always same result)

Fast access (average O(1) time)

- Problem
Collision: Two keys might map to the same memory location.
