- # Why Should You Learn Graphs?

  - 1. Graphs are essential when I need to model connections between nodes
       - Social networks (follwers,friendships)
       - Maps( locations and paths, shortest routes)
       - Recommendation systems (users connected to interests)
       - Web crawling (pages linked to other pages)

  - 2. Graph algorithms are core topics in coding interviews
    - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
    - DFS (Depth- First Search)
    - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (shortest path)
    - Topolgical Sort (ordering tasks)

- What is the Graph exactly?
  - A graph is made of nodes and edges to represent relationships.
