# Topic: Recursive Binary Search Tree

    - Why use it?
        - To leverage the structural property of BST for efficient value searching
        - More readable than iterative approaches

    - When use it?
        - When checking whether a specific value exists in a BST
        - For any DFS-based traversal logic

    - Key Points
        - Traverses left/right subtree recursively
        - Time complexity: O(log n) on average, O(n) in worst-case(unbalanced trees)
        - Follows DFS traversal principles
