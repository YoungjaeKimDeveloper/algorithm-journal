Today's Notes

1. Array VS LinkedList
    A LinkedList consists of a head and a tail.

    Each node points to the next node.

    The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

    A linked list is not stored in contiguous memory; each node can be stored anywhere in memory.

2. Big O Notation
    O(n) - For example, removing the last element(pop) in a singly linked list requires the list.
    
    O(1) - Some operations like addingto the end(with a tail reference) can be done in constant time.

    Choosing Data Structures
    Always consider when a data structure is useful and which one is optimal for the situation.

    Node as an Object
        A node is an object in Javascript

    JavaScript Object = a flexible data struture for grouping related data and behavior using key-value pairs.
