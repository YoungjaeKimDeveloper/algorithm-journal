Queue -> FIFO

Basic Concept
EnQueue: Add item to the end (like "get in line")

DeQueue: Remove item from the front (like "leave the line")

Order: First inserted â†’ First removed

For simple use: JavaScript arrays are fine.

For performance: use Linked List-based Queue (especially for frequent DeQueue).

Queue keeps first and last pointers for efficient operations.

First In First Out
