Today's Notes

1. Primitive vs Reference Types

   - Primitive values (e.g., numbers, strings) are copied by value.
   - Reference types (e.g., arrays, objects) are assigned by reference, meaning both variables point to the same memory location.

2. Understanding Pointers in JavaScript
   - Reference types (objects, arrays) act like pointers.
   - If one changes, the other reflects the same changes due to shared memory.

Reflections:

- It finally makes sense to me why arrays and objects behave differently from primitive values.
  They're not just "different types" — they actually point to memory, which changes how assignment and mutation work.

  Also, I’ve noticed that taking the time to really slow down and understand the details helps way more than trying to rush through tutorials. Even a short 6-minute video can take me 20 minutes if I’m pausing and thinking through it — but it sticks with me. And that feels like real progress.
