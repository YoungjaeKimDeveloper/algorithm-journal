# 10-04-2025 Hash Map

- Hash Map Reflection (10-04-2025)
  Example: {nails: 1000}
  → nails is the key, 1000 is the value

- Core Idea
  A key is used to directly access the value in memory

Acts like an address to find data fast

Only the key is searchable — not the value

- Key Features
  One-way (key → value only)

Deterministic (same key → always same result)

Fast access (average O(1) time)

- Problem
  Collision: Two keys might map to the same memory location.

# 11-04-2025 Hash Map - 2

it is a pair in hash map {key:value}

what is the Hashes?

1. They are one way. [The value only can be found by key value]

- Internally, the key is processed through a hash function and converted into an index, where the value is then stored.

- The key is always hashed to determine the storage location, and the value is saved at that specific index.

2. set - set the key and value in the hash table.

3. How to deal with the Collisions?

   - Separate Chaining : Create new array
   - Oepn Addressing: open new address

4. it is similar with Javascript object [dictionary]
