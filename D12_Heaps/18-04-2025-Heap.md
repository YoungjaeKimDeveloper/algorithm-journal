- Max Heap, Min Heap,
- Heapify(head) - sort the array  O(n)
- Mimum O(1)
- Maximum O(1)
- Heapify:O(n)
- Push

- Purpose
  - To quickly access the maximum or minimum element(priority queues, task schedulers, heap sort)


- Why use Heaps?
    - Fast insertion & deletion O(log n)
    - Access top priority element in O(1) time
    - Not fully sorted, but satisfies heap property
        -> Max Heap : Parent >= Children
        -> Min Heap : Parent <= Children

- Key Characteristics
    - It's a complete binary tree (filled from left to right)
    - Efficiently implemented with arrays
    - Ideal for priority-based processing, not for general Search.
